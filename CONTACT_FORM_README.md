# 📧 Contact Form Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status
Your contact form is **fully functional** and will:
- ✅ Log all submissions to console/terminal
- ✅ Send emails if configured (see setup below)
- ✅ Validate all inputs
- ✅ Provide user feedback
- ✅ **FIXED**: No more React Email dependency errors!

## 🚀 How to Receive Emails on Vercel

### Step 1: Get Your Resend API Key

1. **Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)** (FREE account)
2. **Get your API key** from the dashboard
3. **No additional packages needed** - using direct API calls!

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in your project root:

```bash
# Resend API Key (get from https://resend.com/api-keys)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here

# Your email to receive contact form submissions
CONTACT_EMAIL=arjunrawat4741@gmail.com
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Add the same environment variables
   - Redeploy

2. **Deploy your changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed contact form email functionality"
git push
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### What Was Fixed:
- ❌ **Before**: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@react-email/render'`
- ✅ **After**: Direct Resend API calls (no extra dependencies)

### How It Works:
- Uses `fetch()` to call Resend API directly
- No React Email dependencies required
- Cleaner, more reliable implementation
- Same beautiful HTML email templates

## 📧 What Emails You'll Receive

### When someone contacts you:

1. **Notification email to you** with:
   - Contact person's name and email
   - Their message
   - Timestamp
   - Reply button for easy response

2. **Confirmation email to them** with:
   - Thank you message
   - What to expect next
   - Links to your GitHub/LinkedIn

## 🔧 Current Behavior

### Without Email Setup:
- ✅ Form works perfectly
- ✅ Messages logged to console
- ✅ User gets success message
- ❌ No emails sent

### With Email Setup:
- ✅ Everything above PLUS
- ✅ You receive email notifications
- ✅ Sender gets confirmation email
- ✅ Professional email templates

## 📱 Where to Check Messages

### Development (localhost):
- Check your **terminal/console** where `npm run dev` is running
- You'll see: `📧 New contact form submission: { name, email, message }`

### Production (Vercel):
- Check **Vercel dashboard** → Functions tab → Logs
- You'll receive **emails** if configured
- Can also check Vercel logs for console output

## 🎯 Quick Test

1. **Test locally**: Fill your contact form → check terminal
2. **Test on Vercel**: Deploy → fill form → check email

## ⚡ Alternative: Quick Gmail Setup

If you prefer Gmail, you can also use Nodemailer:

```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

Then use Gmail App Password instead of Resend. But Resend is easier and more reliable for portfolios.
